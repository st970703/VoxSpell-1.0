Tips:
1. This version uses Java SDK 1.7.
2. The video file and NZCER-spelling-lists.txt must be placed in the same directory as the SpellingAid.jar
3. Please wait for Festival to finish speaking before typing.
4. Please FFMPEG and at least one of the festival voice packages are installed.
5. If you want to load your own file, it is best if you can copy it into the current directory first and select this specific copy.
This reduces the possibility of errors when the programs tries to read the file.
